Hi there!

My name is Richard, I'm a front-end developer crazy about documentation and currently smitten with TypeScript.

- 🔭 Focused on TypeScript, React and GraphQL
- 🌱 Currently learning more about accessibility!
- 💬 What else do I do? Running, cooking and watching TV Series (not necessarily in that order)
