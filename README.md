### Richard Pacheco

I'm a front-end developer crazy about documentation and clean code who got swept off my feet by TypeScript.

- ðŸ”­ Focused on TypeScript, React and GraphQL
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning GraphQL
- ðŸ‘¯ Currently collaborating on TypeScript localization
- ðŸ’¬ What else do I do? Running, cooking and watching TV Series (not necessarily in that order)
